# RLVR Pipeline Coding Rules (Concise)

## Python
- Format with Black, 79-char lines.
- Use isort (Black profile) for imports.
- Use type hints for all functions; no untyped defs (mypy strict).
- Use Google-style docstrings for public methods/classes.
- Use double quotes for strings.
- Follow PEP8 for style and import order.

## Structure
- All components inherit from `BaseComponent` and implement `validate_config()`.
- Organize code in `src/components/`, `src/orchestration/`, `src/utils/`.
- Configs live in `conf/`, use Hydra `_target_` for instantiation.

## Configuration
- All behavior is config-driven (YAML in `conf/`).
- Validate configs in each component.

## Quality & Workflow
- Use pre-commit hooks: black, isort, flake8, mypy.
- Use Poetry for dependency management.
- Never hardcode secrets; use environment variables.

## Naming
- snake_case for files/functions, PascalCase for classes, kebab-case for YAML.

## Git
- Use feature branches, atomic commits, and pull requests.

## Quick Commands
- Run format: `poetry run black src/ tests/`
- Run lint: `poetry run flake8 src/ tests/`
- Run type check: `poetry run mypy src/`
- Run tests: `poetry run pytest`
- Run pipeline: `python run_pipeline.py`
